# UniversityMatriculation
I was always last on the matriculation list at my University, which meant I consistently got a horrible schedule, because I could only enroll to different groups with different timetables. I created this bot to solve this issue.

# What this bot did
It logged into my university's matriculation system with my account, and checked periodically if there was free slot in a group I wanted to be in (sometimes some students dropped from a certain group and their slots would be freed). If a group was available, it automatically enrolled me into that group.

The university changed it matriculation system, so this bot no longer works.
